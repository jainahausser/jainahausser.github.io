## *COMM 165 - Data Storytelling*
My name is Jaina Hausser and I am a senior Cognitive science major at Lehigh University. I'm from Hillsborough, New Jersey but I'm currently living in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This is a page dedicated for my Data Storytelling class and I can't wait to produce some cool data visualizations!
